# Hello-World
My beginnings in Coding...sure to be a mess. A mess I love!

OmegaAlphaTau- Here goes my attempts at coding....hopefully I can learn quite a few languages to use...
Trying to learn languages as being an Astrophysicist can use some Computer Language background...
besides I had friends excelling me in this field, and would try to learn myself...
